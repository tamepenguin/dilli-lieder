Love Me, Kender 
von Dragon-Magazine 
(Melodie: "Love Me Tender" von Elvis) 
D
Love me, kender,
E
Love me true.
G                        D
Steal away my heart.
D                                  E
Keep it where you've put my jewels
G                              D
And that's just the start.

D
Love me, kender,
Love me long.
G                                        D
Each day the pain grows worse.
D                                      E
For though they say that love is blind,
G                             D                             
I saw you take my purse.

Leave me, kender,
Leave me now,
All your pouches filled.
You just don't realize you're a thief
And you never will.
