Oh Jeahr, Jeahr....
(nach „Que sera, sera“, Text Chris Werner)
When I was just a little Demon, I asked Arac „what will I be?“,
„Will I be cruelsome, will I be famous“, here´s what he said to me:

Oh Jeahr, Jeahr, whatever will be, will be,
the Future´s not ours to see,
Oh Jeahr, Jeahr,
what will be, will be.

When grew up and fell by Yak, I asked Arac: „what lies ahead?“
Will we have slaughters, day after day?“,
Here´s what my Father said:

Oh Jeahr, Jeahr, whatever will be, will be,
the Future´s not ours to see,
Oh Jeahr, Jeahr,
what will be, will be.

Now I have Servants of my own, they ask their master:
„what will I be? Will I kill Jochrim, will I kill thee?“
I told them brutally:

I´m Jeahr, Jeahr, whatever will be, will be,
the Future´s is mine to see,
I´m Jeahr, Jeahr,
what will be, will be.

(C.Werner, nach „Que sera“ von Doris Day)
