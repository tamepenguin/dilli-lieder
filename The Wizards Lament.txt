The Wizards Lament 
or The House of the Mended Drum 
             Am   C      D                F
    There is a pub in Ankh-Morpork 
                 Am       C            E   
       They call the Mended Drum 
               Am         C         D                F
And it's been the start of many a poor boy 
                  Am        E           Am   
       And, Gods, I know I'm one.

2. My Father was a fighting man 
He stomped his enemies flat. 
My mother was a working girl 
Who came from cold Sto Lat.

3. Now my father, he had downed a few 
Then said, "Let's have some fun." 
And all night they shook the floorboards loose 
Upstairs in the Mended Drum.

4. At dawn he went down to light a fag 
Twelve crossbows were aimed at him 
He lost his life to the city guard 
For malicious lingering.

5. Now my mother did not cry at all 
For she was unaware 
That inside her woking lady's womb 
A baby she did bear.

6. When nine months, they had come and gone 
My mother did give birth 
She asked her friend, the sausage man 
"What's this snapper worth?"

7. Now the greedy sot was tempted 
And did some research fine. 
But for the family holdings 
Dear dad was eigth in line.

8. What little he would get, of course, 
Was sure to never be mine 
For ahead of this poor bastard son 
Were seven brothers fine.

9. Now it did not take my mother long 
To see what she could reap 
So came the morning Modo found a babe 
On top his compost heap.

10. So here I sit upon my stool 
And to the barman I do confide 
With my pint of scumble at my hand 
And an ape perched by my side.

11. But Death, I see him coming for me
My life he plans to claim
I know I'll never last 'till dawn
And this pub will be the same.

12. So tonite before I leave I swear
A keg, I'll finish one!
And end my days where they began
In that pub called the Mended Drum 
(Nach „House of the rising Sun“ von den Animals)
